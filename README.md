# vue-SalmonCookies

## Author: Justin and Tricia

## Project

The objective of this lab was to recreate our previous Salmon cookies application, using a new framework that we taught ourself, which was Vue.

### Customize configuration

See [Vite Configuration Reference](https://vitejs.dev/config/).

### Project Setup

Run these commands:

1. `npm install`

2. `npm run dev`

### Features

Routes:

- `/` - Home

- `/sales` - Sales

- `/contact` - Contact

#### Pros

- Flexibility

- Syntax (template and script tags) was confusing concept at first, but docs were helpful in a way

- Easy implementation to our already existing code

#### Cons

- Fewer tools available compared to React

- Testing was a struggle

- The docuemntation was helpful, but the concepts weren't explained well so had to find that elsewhere
